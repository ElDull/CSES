1. figured out how to read the input in c++
   (for loop with cin equal to the amount of inputs)
2. learned about sets in c++
   sets are an like an ordered array
   sets also have a set.find() method which when given a number
   returns a pointer to that number in the set
   if it doesnt find a number it returns a pointer to the end of the set
   this method combined with set.end() lets you find the missing number by writing
   if (set.find(i) == set.end()). this means i == missing number.
